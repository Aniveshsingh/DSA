# FUNCTIONS
A block of code or a sub-program that is linked to a well-defined task

why we need a function ??
- Reusable 
- readability

```cpp
int main() {
    for (int i <= 0; i<5; i++){
        cout<< "babbar sher"<<endl;
         } 
    // this prints 5 times babbar 

    for (int i <= 0; i<5; i++){
        cout<< "love"<<endl;
         } 
    // this prints 5 times love 

    for (int i <= 0; i<5; i++){
        cout<< "Anivesh"<<endl;
         } 
    // this prints 5 times Anivesh 

    for (int i <= 0; i<5; i++){
        cout<< "Mummy"<<endl;
         } 
    // this prints 5 times Mummy 

    for (int i <= 0; i<5; i++){
        cout<< "mouse"<<endl;
         } 
    // this prints 5 times mouse 

}
```

if you observe in the above code u can see that the above code is only printing a particular string at a time, but it also gives poor readability, maybe this code can be buggy also it became a bulky code etc

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
 
void printName(string name) {            // we created a function whose job is to print
     for (int i <= 0; i<5; i++){
        cout<< name <<endl;
         } 
}

int main() {
   
   printName("babbar");
   printName("love");
   printName("Anivesh");
   printName("Mummy");
   printName("Mouse");

}
```

now this code improves my readability, whenever i have to use the code, we just have to call the function, if the code has any bugs in it then we just have to fix it one time at one place only.

>[!important]
>Any set of logic which we intend to reuse then we write a function for it 

# Syntax
```cpp
return-type function-name ( input-parameter ) {

-- logic ---

return 0    // it tells that our program is successfully executed. whos executes the program, who alots the memory to it ???  --> Operating system 

}
```

## lets create a simple function 
we have to create a function that when it is called it prints a string i.e "Sundar ko sundari pasand hai" 10 times

lets see how to create a function and what things to keep in mind while creating it 

- first we have to decide the return-type, ---> is the function returning something --> NO, it is just printing 
    - so in this case, it is not returning something. so we will use void 

- ( input-parameter ) , it has to print a same given string only i.e "Sundar ko sundari pasand hai" so no input parameter

```cpp
void printLine() {
    for (int i=0 ; i<10; i++) {
        cout<<"Sundar ko sundari pasand hai"<<endl;
    }
}

int main(){

    // function call
    printLine();        //prints the string 10 times
}
```

## 
- function declare
- function definiton
- function call

>[!note]
>- to call a function we have to make sure that the function is defined before calling the function
>- if you want to define the function after calling the function then make sure it has been atleast declared before calling the function

>[!tip]
>- Always define your function before main 

## FUNCTION CALL STACK / CALL STACK / EXECUTION STACK
- The last function in, that will be the first function out ( LAST IN FIRST OUT ) ==> LIFO 
 
**jab function call milti hai toh entry add krte hai, jab koi function body khatam ho jaati hai i.e closed bracket yaa phir function se kch return ho jaata hai toh entry remove kr dete hai**

when a program starts executing a call stack is created and since main is the entry point of our code and also main is function too with a return-type of integer so firstly when the execution starts main function is entered in the call stack and main only removes when the execution of the stack is ended as said call stack uses LIFO

ques: write a function to print sum of 3 nos.
```cpp
```

ques : write a function to return sum of 3 nos.
```cpp
```

can we use return in void ??
we can use return keyword inside void but make sure not to send any values with the return keyword


questions
1. find max of 3 nos a,b,c
2. Counting from 1 to N
3. Check prime no or not
4. check even or odd
5. sum of all no upto 1 to N
6. sum of all even no up 1 to N

hw wale ques
1. function to find area of circle
2. function to find factorial of a number
3. print all prime number from 1 to N
